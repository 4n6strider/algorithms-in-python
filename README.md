# Algorithm Implementations

This is just a collection of algorithms I wanted to implement in order to improve my understanding. They are NOT optimized and probably shouldn't be used in production code.

To run tests for a specific module:

    python3 <module_name>.py

To run all unit tests:

    python3 -m unittest discover test
